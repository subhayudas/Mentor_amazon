    "spamAnswer": "Absolutely not. We respect your inbox and privacy. You'll only receive essential communications: session confirmations, reminders 24 hours before your meetings, and occasional program updates you can opt out of anytime. We never share your email with third parties, and you have full control over your notification preferences in your profile settings.",
    "commitmentQuestion": "What is the time commitment for mentors?",
    "commitmentAnswer": "You're in control of your availability. Whether you can offer one session per month or several per week, our flexible scheduling adapts to your calendar. Most mentors dedicate 1-2 hours monthly, but there's no minimum requirement. You set your own pace.",
    "matchingQuestion": "How are mentors and mentees matched?",
    "matchingAnswer": "Mentees browse our mentor directory and choose mentors based on expertise, industry experience, and availability. This self-selection approach ensures both parties are aligned on goals and expectations from the start.",
    "cancelQuestion": "What if I need to cancel or reschedule?",
    "cancelAnswer": "Life happens! You can cancel or reschedule any session through your calendar link. We just ask for 24 hours notice when possible so the other party can adjust their schedule accordingly."
