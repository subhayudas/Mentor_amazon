# Development Requirements for Mentor-Mentee Platform

## CRITICAL: Implementation Standards
- Each feature below must be fully functional with robust error handling
- Test all user flows thoroughly before marking as complete
- Implement data validation on both frontend and backend
- Ensure responsive design works across all devices
- Add loading states and user feedback for all actions

---

## 1. Analytics Dashboard - Geographic Statistics

**Requirements:**
- Add country-based statistics displaying the geographic distribution of mentors and mentees
- Show data in two separate views/sections:
  - Mentor locations by country (with counts)
  - Mentee locations by country (with counts)
- Include visual representation (charts/maps recommended)
- Ensure data updates in real-time as new users register

**Technical Notes:**
- Store country data during user registration
- Implement data aggregation queries efficiently
- Consider using a library like Chart.js or Recharts for visualization

---

## 2. Mentor Signup Form - Mentorship Preference

**Requirements:**
- Add a new required field asking mentors to select their preferred mentorship model:
  - Option 1: "Ongoing mentorship with one mentee" (long-term commitment)
  - Option 2: "Different mentees each session" (flexible, rotating mentees)
- Make this a clear radio button or dropdown selection
- Store this preference in the mentor's profile
- Use this data in the matching algorithm

**Validation:**
- Field must be required (cannot submit without selection)
- Display clear descriptions for each option so mentors understand the commitment

---

## 3. Mentee Signup Form - Organizational Information

**Requirements:**
- Research Taproot+ platform (taproot.org or similar mentorship platforms) to understand what organizational information they collect
- Add comprehensive fields for mentee organizations including:
  - Organization name
  - Organization type/sector
  - Mission statement or description
  - Current challenges/goals for mentorship
  - Team size
  - Website/social media links
  - Any other relevant fields found in Taproot's model

**Action Item:**
- Before implementing, share the proposed fields list for review
- Ensure all fields have proper validation and help text

---

## 4. Bilingual Support - English/Arabic Toggle

**Requirements:**
- Implement complete bilingual support for the entire platform
- Add a language toggle switch (visible on all pages):
  - English ⇄ Arabic switching
  - Placed in header/navigation for easy access
  - Persist language preference in user session/cookies
- All UI elements, forms, buttons, labels, navigation, and content must be translatable
- Use a proper internationalization (i18n) framework:
  - Recommended: react-i18next for React or similar for your stack
  - Create separate translation files (en.json, ar.json)
- Handle right-to-left (RTL) layout for Arabic:
  - Text alignment
  - Layout mirroring where appropriate
  - Maintain proper spacing and formatting

**Critical:**
- Every piece of text on the platform must have translations
- Test thoroughly in both languages
- Ensure form validations work in both languages

---

## 5. Contextual Information Above Signup Forms

**Implementation Note:**
- Leave placeholder sections above both mentor and mentee signup forms
- These sections should be easily editable (consider using a CMS or admin panel)
- Will add content describing expectations, benefits, and process
- Make the layout flexible to accommodate text, lists, and potentially images

**Structure:**
- Clear heading: "What to Expect"
- Expandable/collapsible sections if content is lengthy
- Must be visible on both English and Arabic versions

---

## 6. Mentor Session Approval System (High Priority, Complex)

**Requirements:**
- Implement a session request workflow:
  1. Mentee requests a session with a mentor
  2. Mentor receives notification of the request
  3. Mentor can view session details (date, time, mentee info, topic)
  4. Mentor has options to:
     - **Accept** - Session is confirmed and added to both calendars
     - **Reject** - Mentee is notified, session not scheduled
     - **Propose alternative time** (optional enhancement)
  5. Only after mentor acceptance does the session appear on calendars

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create a "Pending Sessions" view for mentors
- Add notification system (email/in-app) when new session requested
- Implement session status tracking (pending/accepted/rejected)
- Update calendar integration only after acceptance
- Send confirmation notifications to both parties
- Handle timeout scenarios (if mentor doesn't respond within X days)

**User Experience:**
- Clear notification badges for pending requests
- Easy-to-use accept/reject interface
- Show all relevant session information before decision
- Provide feedback messages after each action

**Fallback Plan:**
- If too complex initially, document the feature clearly for Phase 2
- At minimum, implement email notifications to mentors about new bookings with session details

## Testing Checklist

Before considering any feature complete, verify:
- [ ] Works in both English and Arabic
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] All form validations work
- [ ] Database properly stores all data
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] User receives appropriate feedback
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Tested with real-world data scenarios

---

## Priority Order

1. **HIGH:** Bilingual toggle (foundation for all other features)
2. **HIGH:** Mentor signup preference field (simple, critical for matching)
3. **MEDIUM:** Analytics geographic statistics
4. **MEDIUM:** Enhanced mentee signup form
5. **MEDIUM:** Mentor session approval system
6. **LOW:** Contextual information sections (content pending)

## CRITICAL: Implementation Constraints

**NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **DO NOT break existing functionality** - All current features must continue working exactly as they do now
2. **DO NOT change the core architecture** - Keep the existing tech stack and structure
3. **Make minimal, surgical changes** - Add new features without refactoring existing code
4. **Test existing features after each change** - Ensure nothing breaks
5. **Keep the app runnable at all times** - Never leave it in a non-functional state

## Technical Decisions - Use Existing Solutions

For any unknowns, **use whatever is already in the codebase**:

- **Country list**: Use a standard library (like country-list npm package) or simple dropdown with major countries
- **Calendar system**: If calendar integration exists, extend it. If not, start with a simple database-stored schedule
- **Notifications**: If email is set up, use that. If nothing exists, start with in-app notifications only (simplest)
- **i18n implementation**: Use the most popular library for your framework (react-i18next for React, vue-i18n for Vue, etc.)
- **Admin content editing**: For now, just hardcode the contextual text in a separate config file that can be easily edited later

## Development Approach

1. **Analyze the existing codebase first** - Understand what's already there before adding anything
2. **Add features incrementally** - One at a time, test, commit, then move to next
3. **Use feature flags if possible** - So new features can be turned off if they cause issues
4. **Keep backups/commits frequent** - So you can roll back if something breaks
5. **Default to the simplest working solution** - Don't over-engineer

## If You Hit a Blocker

- **Don't guess** - Ask for clarification if something is unclear about existing code
- **Don't break things to add features** - If a feature would require major changes, flag it and suggest a simpler alternative
- **Provide options** - If you're unsure about implementation approach, present 2-3 options with pros/cons

The goal is **new features that integrate smoothly**, not a rewrite. Preserve what works, add what's needed.
