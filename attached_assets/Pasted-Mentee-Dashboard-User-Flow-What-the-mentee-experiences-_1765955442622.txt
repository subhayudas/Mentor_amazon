Mentee Dashboard – User Flow (What the mentee experiences)
A. Mentee logs in → lands on Mentee Dashboard

Dashboard should show (dynamic):

Upcoming approved sessions

Pending booking requests

Past sessions (optional for now)

Notifications (accepted / rejected)

👉 Rule:
If no data exists, show empty states, NOT fake numbers.

Example:

“You don’t have any upcoming sessions yet. Find a mentor to get started.”

B. Mentee searches & views a Mentor Profile

From:

Mentor listing / search results

Clicks:

View Profile

Sees:

Mentor bio

Expertise

Availability note (no calendar yet)

CTA: “Request a Session”

2. Booking Form Flow (This replaces direct Cal booking)
A. Mentee clicks “Request a Session”

➡️ Opens a modal / popup form (VERY IMPORTANT for demo clarity)

Form fields (keep minimal):

Name (auto-filled if logged in)

Email (auto-filled if logged in)

What are you hoping to achieve from this session? (textarea)

Buttons:

Submit Request

Cancel

B. On Submit (what happens behind the scenes)

Create a Booking Request object in DB:

{
  id: "req_123",
  mentee_id: "mentee_45",
  mentor_id: "mentor_12",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@email.com",
  goal: "Career guidance for product roles",
  status: "PENDING",
  created_at: "timestamp"
}


🚫 No calendar invite yet
🚫 No Cal link sent yet

C. What the mentee sees immediately after submission

Toast / confirmation:

“Your request has been sent to the mentor. You’ll be notified once they respond.”

Dashboard updates in real time:

Pending Requests: +1

New card under Pending Bookings

3. Mentor Side – Approval Flow (MOST IMPORTANT FIX)
A. Mentor logs in → Mentor Dashboard

Dashboard must dynamically show:

Pending booking requests (count + list)

Upcoming approved sessions

Recent activity

Example dashboard card:

Pending Requests (1)
John Doe – “Career guidance for product roles”

👉 Clicking this card redirects to Booking Requests page

B. Booking Requests Page (Mentor Inbox)

Each request card shows:

Mentee name

Email

Goal / context

Timestamp

Buttons:

✅ Accept

❌ Decline

C. Mentor clicks Accept
System actions:

Update request status:

status: "ACCEPTED"


Generate mentor’s Cal booking link

Send email (or in-platform notification) to mentee:

“Your request has been accepted. Book a time here: [Cal Link]”

Create a Session placeholder:

{
  id: "session_789",
  mentor_id: "mentor_12",
  mentee_id: "mentee_45",
  status: "AWAITING_TIME_SELECTION"
}

D. Mentor clicks Decline
System actions:

Update request status:

status: "REJECTED"


Notify mentee:

“Your request was declined by the mentor.”

Nothing goes to calendar

4. Calendar Booking Flow (After Acceptance)
A. Mentee clicks Cal link

Selects time

Confirms booking

B. After time is booked

Update Session object:

{
  status: "CONFIRMED",
  start_time: "...",
  end_time: "...",
  cal_event_id: "abc123"
}


📩 Calendar invites sent only now

5. Making the Dashboards 100% Dynamic (No Hardcoding)
A. Single Source of Truth (IMPORTANT)

You should NOT rely on Cal for dashboard data.

Your platform DB should track:

Requests

Sessions

Status changes

Cal = only for final scheduling

B. Mentee Dashboard – Dynamic Sections
1. Pending Requests

Query:

WHERE mentee_id = X AND status = 'PENDING'

2. Upcoming Sessions
WHERE mentee_id = X AND status = 'CONFIRMED' AND start_time > now()

3. Past Sessions
WHERE mentee_id = X AND status = 'COMPLETED'

C. Mentor Dashboard – Dynamic Sections
1. Pending Requests (CRITICAL)
WHERE mentor_id = X AND status = 'PENDING'


This powers:

Dashboard count

“Pending bookings” card

Booking Requests page

2. Upcoming Sessions
WHERE mentor_id = X AND status = 'CONFIRMED'
